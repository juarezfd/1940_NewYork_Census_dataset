# 1940_NewYork_Census_dataset


binder creates an online environment where you can run something like a jupyter notebook and edit it (e.g., add cells, remove, change code). I suggest you clear and rerun all cells.

Also, keep in mind that the binder might take a while to load. I looked through the csv and selected some columns that i felt might be relevant for what you wanted to look into.
